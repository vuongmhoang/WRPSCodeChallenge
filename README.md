# WRPSCodeChallenge
1) Given two dictionaries in two different languages (example: English and Spanish), return all words that are spelled the same in both languages.
Below are some sample inputs and expected outputs:

English:
"bean",
"cab",
"no",
"ocean",
"once",
"one"
   
Spanish:            
"acaba",             
"cena",              
"con",               
"nace"
"no",             
"once",                    

Return:
"no",
"once"


==========

English:
"bean"
"cab"

Spanish:
"no"
"once"

Return:
(empty list)


==========
English:
"sister"

Spanish:
"si"

Return:
(empty list)


2) (Optional) Write a web API (Application Programming Interface) that uses the code in part 1 to allow users to submit their own lists of words and return the set of words that are spelled the same. This part is not necessary but we'd love to see you try it!



You can use any language or environment for your solution. Unit tests are encouraged but not required.

To submit your answer, either email a zip folder back to us containing the source code or commit your solution to source control (Bitbucket/GitHub/GitLab/etc) and email us a link to the code repository. Feel free to email us any questions you might have.
